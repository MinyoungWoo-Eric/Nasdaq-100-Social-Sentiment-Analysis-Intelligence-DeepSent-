# Our Purpose
## 1. Traditional Challenge: Information Overload
### Traditional Manual Analysis Pain Points
- Scattered Information
- Time-Consuming
- No Consistency - different narratives for the same stock
- Shallow Insights - simple sentiment scores without context

### Consequences
- Delayed Decisions
- Missed Signals
- Audit Gaps
- Low Confidence


## 2. Solution: Sentiment Analysis Report
### Single-Channel Reliability (Not Multi-Channel Noise)
- Alpha Vantage - curated, quality-controlled financial news with sentiment
- Signal Quality Over Quantity (Coverage Breadth) – eliminate social media misinformation & emotional noise

### Customizable Parameters (User Control Over Data Volume)
- Number of Articles per Day 
- Time Window -> Focus on Recent Momentum or Long-Term Trends

### Deep AI Insights (Powered by GPT-4o)
- Root Cause Analysis
- Theme Extraction
- Anomaly Detection
- Short-term Implication
- Event Timeline

### Professional Export
- Download as Markdown Format
- Includes Charts, Indicators, Narratives, and Timeline 


## 3. Potential Impact & Strategic Value
### Deep Analysis
- Not a Single Sentiment Score
- Combine Score + Root Cause + Thematic Breakdown (all sourced)
- Improve Confidence in Decisions

### Better Risk Management
- Elaboration on which events drive each sentiment shift
- Proactive identification of sentiment-driven risks
- Data-backed risk assessment
- Root cause analysis distinguishes signal from noise

### Reliability
- All Insights Source-Anchored
- Zero Hallucination through RAG Technology
- Enhance Decision Confidence through Transparency & Traceability

### Massive Time Savings
- Spend less time on collecting & summarizing information across various sources
- More time on judgement & strategy development (AI handles heavy lifting)


## 4. Intended Users & Use Cases
A common pain point: `Information Fragmentation`\
Benefit from the same value: `Decisive, Professional-Grade Intelligence Delivered Fast`
| User Type | Core Use Cases |
|-----------|----------------|
| Portfolio Managers | Early sentiment signals for timing, position sizing, and risk alerts |
| Equity Researchers | Faster, richer market-color narratives for client conversations |
| Risk & Compliance | Sentiment shock detection and audit-ready monitoring logs |
| Individual Active Traders / Investors | Professional-grade sentiment analysis for personal portfolio decisions (no need to build own infrastructure) |


## 5. System Architecture: Multi-Staged AI Agent

## 6. Governance & Responsible AI Design
Didn't treat compliance as an afterthought. It's baked into the design:
### Data Governance
- Public Data Only (Alpha Vantage & Yahoo Finance)
- Complete Source Transparency
- No Personal Data Collection

### AI Transparency
- Show Articles (with source evidence) behind Sentiment Scores
- RAG-Anchored Narratives (no hallucinations)

### Human-in-the-Loop
- Decision-Support Tool Only 
- No Autonomous Trading Functionality
- Sentiment as One Signal among Many (not sole decision driver)

### Regulatory Alignment
- Positioned as Research Tool, Not Investment Advice
- Audit-Ready Design for Compliance Requirements


## 7. Technology: Availability of Core Components
| Component | Technology Used | Key Capabilities |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| Interface | Streamlit | Rapid construction of interactive interfaces (stock search + data display + report generation) |
| Data Collection | Alpha Vantage | Reliable financial news + sentiment data |
| Data Collection | Yahoo Finance | Core trading indicators, price/volume information |
| Sentiment Processing | RAG Technology | Efficiently retrieve and integrate multi-source sentiment text; solve "limited content quality per API call" issue |
| AI Report Generation | GPT-4o | Professional financial analysis capabilities; support multi-round calls to compile in-depth long reports |
